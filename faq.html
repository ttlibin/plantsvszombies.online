                <div class="faq-question">What are the best strategies for beginners in Plants vs Zombies?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    New players should focus on establishing a strong economic foundation by planting multiple Sunflowers early in each level. Don't rush to plant offensive plants; instead, use free defensive options to handle initial zombies while building your sunlight reserves. Learn to recognize different zombie types and their weaknesses, and always maintain a balanced defense with both offensive and defensive plants.

                <div class="faq-question">How do I unlock new plants in Plants vs Zombies?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    New plants in <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> are unlocked progressively as you advance through Adventure mode. Each level completion may introduce new plant options, and some plants become available through the in-game shop using coins collected during gameplay.

                <div class="faq-question">What is sunlight and how do I get more of it?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Sunlight is the primary resource in <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong>, used to plant and deploy your defensive plants. In daytime levels, sunlight naturally falls from the sky. You can also generate sunlight by planting Sunflowers or Sun-shrooms. Managing your sunlight economy is crucial - balance between producing sunlight and spending it on defensive plants.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How do I deal with different environments like pools and rooftops?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Each environment in <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> requires different strategies. For pool levels, you'll need Lily Pads to plant land-based plants in water. For rooftop levels, you must use lobbed-shot plants like Cabbage-pults since direct-shooting plants can't hit zombies on the sloped terrain. Night levels require Sun-shrooms or Gloom-shrooms for sunlight production. Adapting your plant selection to each environment is key to success.
