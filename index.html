        <!-- What is Plants vs Zombies -->
        <section class="content-section" id="what-is">
            <h2>What is Plants vs Zombies?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> stands as one of the most beloved tower defense games ever created, capturing the hearts of millions since its initial release in May 2009. Developed by the renowned PopCap Games and later published by Electronic Arts, <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> revolutionized the tower defense genre with its unique blend of strategy, humor, and accessible gameplay mechanics.
            </p>
            <p>
                At its core, <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> presents players with a deceptively simple premise: protect your home from an endless horde of zombies by strategically placing various plants across your lawn. The game's charm lies in its ability to transform a potentially dark theme into a lighthearted, family-friendly experience that appeals to players of all ages.
            </p>
            <p>
                The original <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> game features 49 distinct plant varieties, each possessing unique abilities and characteristics. From the humble Peashooter to the mighty Cob Cannon, every plant serves a specific purpose in your defensive arsenal. Meanwhile, 26 different zombie types challenge players with increasingly complex behaviors and attack patterns, ensuring that no two levels feel exactly the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                What sets <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> apart from other tower defense games is its perfect balance between simplicity and depth. Newcomers can grasp the basic mechanics within minutes, yet the game offers enough strategic complexity to keep veteran players engaged for hours. The progression system gradually introduces new plants, zombies, and environmental challenges, creating a natural learning curve that never feels overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game's enduring popularity has led to numerous sequels and spin-offs, but the original <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> remains the gold standard for tower defense enthusiasts. Its timeless appeal stems from polished gameplay, memorable characters, and the satisfaction of watching a well-planned strategy unfold across your lawn.

        <section class="content-section" id="features">
            <h2>Game Features of Plants vs Zombies</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> offers an impressive array of features that contribute to its legendary status in the gaming world. Understanding these features helps players appreciate the depth and craftsmanship that went into creating this masterpiece.
            </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Diverse Plant Arsenal</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> experience centers around collecting and strategically deploying 49 different plant species. Each plant falls into distinct categories: producers like Sunflowers generate the sunlight currency essential for planting; offensive plants such as Peashooters and Repeaters deal damage; defensive plants like Wall-nuts and Tall-nuts block zombie advancement; and special plants like Cherry Bombs provide instant area-of-effect damage.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Multiple Game Modes</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> doesn't limit players to a single gameplay experience. The Adventure mode takes players through 50 carefully crafted levels across five distinct environments: daytime lawns, nighttime gardens, foggy backyards, swimming pools, and rooftop battles. Each environment introduces unique mechanics that force players to adapt their strategies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond Adventure mode, <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> includes Mini-Games that offer creative variations on the core gameplay, Puzzle modes that challenge players with unique scenarios like Vasebreaker and I, Zombie, and Survival modes that test endurance with increasingly difficult waves. The Zen Garden provides a peaceful alternative where players can cultivate plants and earn coins without the pressure of zombie attacks.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Dynamic Environments and Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    The environmental variety in <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> significantly impacts gameplay strategy. Night levels reduce natural sunlight, requiring players to rely on Sun-shrooms or Gloom-shrooms. Pool levels introduce aquatic lanes that necessitate the use of Lily Pads as planting foundations. Rooftop levels feature sloped terrain that prevents direct-shooting plants from hitting zombies, forcing players to use lobbed-shot plants instead.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Resource Management System</h3>
                <p>
                    Sunlight serves as the primary currency in <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong>, creating a constant strategic decision-making process. Players must balance between investing in sunlight production (Sunflowers) and immediate defensive capabilities (Peashooters). This economic element adds a layer of depth that elevates <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> beyond simple tower placement.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Progressive Difficulty and Unlock System</h3>
                <p>
                    As players advance through <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong>, they unlock new plants, encounter new zombie types, and face increasingly complex challenges. This progression system maintains engagement by constantly introducing fresh elements while allowing players to master each new addition before moving forward.

        <!-- How to Play -->
        <section class="content-section" id="how-to-play">
            <h2>How to Play Plants vs Zombies</h2>
            <p>
                Mastering <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> requires understanding fundamental strategies while remaining flexible enough to adapt to each level's unique challenges. Here's a comprehensive guide to getting started and excelling at this classic game.
            </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Basic Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> operates on a simple grid system: your lawn consists of five to six horizontal lanes, and zombies move from right to left along these lanes. Your goal is to prevent any zombie from reaching the left edge of the screen. Each plant occupies one grid square and cannot move once planted, though you can use the Shovel to remove plants and reclaim their grid space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game begins with a seed packet selection phase where you choose which plants to bring into battle. This selection becomes crucial as you progress, as different levels require different plant combinations. Once the level starts, sunlight appears on your lawn, either naturally falling from the sky (day levels) or generated by your Sunflowers or Sun-shrooms.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Essential Starting Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    For beginners playing <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong>, the most important principle is establishing an economic foundation. Your first few actions should focus on planting Sunflowers in the back rows to generate consistent sunlight income. Resist the urge to plant offensive plants immediately; instead, use free defensive options like Potato Mines or Cherry Bombs to handle the first few zombies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As your sunlight economy stabilizes, begin planting Peashooters in the middle rows. These basic offensive plants provide reliable damage output at a low cost. Place Wall-nuts in the front row to absorb zombie damage and give your offensive plants more time to eliminate threats.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Advanced Tactical Approaches</h3>
                <p>
                    Experienced <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> players develop sophisticated strategies based on zombie types and level conditions. Against fast-moving zombies like Pole Vaulting Zombies, Tall-nuts provide better protection than regular Wall-nuts. For flying zombies like Balloon Zombies, you'll need Cattails or Blovers to eliminate them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key to success in <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> lies in understanding zombie weaknesses and plant synergies. For example, Snow Peas slow down zombies, making them easier targets for other plants. Chompers can instantly eliminate zombies but require time to digest, making them risky but powerful choices.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Special Plant Combinations</h3>
                <p>
                    Certain plants in <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> work exceptionally well together. The combination of Torchwood and Peashooters creates fire peas that deal double damage. Kernel-pults can butter zombies, temporarily freezing them in place. Understanding these interactions allows players to create powerful defensive formations.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Managing Resources and Timing</h3>
                <p>
                    Effective resource management separates skilled <strong>Plants vs Zombies</strong> players from beginners. Always maintain a reserve of sunlight for emergency situations, such as sudden zombie rushes or unexpected zombie types. Learn the cooldown times for instant-use plants like Cherry Bombs and Jalapenos, as these can save you from otherwise impossible situations.
